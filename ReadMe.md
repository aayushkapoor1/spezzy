Spezzy is a Mario-inspired platform game. I created Spezzy using C++ and the Allegro 5 game library. I chose to program in C++ to demonstrate and test my knowledge of OOP and to create customized game logic, such as a custom gravity and collision system. The game has a functional UI with working buttons and incorporates digital audio and a victory screen when the user finishes the game. Finally, the game outputs the number of times a user dies and records it in a text file.
